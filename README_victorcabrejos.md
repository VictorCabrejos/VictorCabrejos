# 👋 Hi, I’m Victor Cabrejos

🎯 **Machine Learning & Generative AI Engineer in Fast Track Mode**  
I’m an educator, engineer, and AI builder based in Lima, Peru — blending software engineering best practices with fast, monetizable GenAI projects. My mission is to create deployable, teachable, and scalable ML systems that bring real-world value to students, developers, and businesses.

## 🚀 Current Focus (2025)
- Building **production-ready ML/GenAI apps** using:
  `FastAPI`, `LangChain`, `Streamlit`, `OpenAI API`, `Docker`, `GitHub Actions`, `MLflow`
- Developing projects for **Hugging Face Spaces**, **AWS Lambda**, and **Railway**
- Creating **4-hour mini-projects** that can be taught, monetized, or deployed
- Teaching MLOps and LLM development in Spanish and English 🇵🇪🇺🇸
- Documenting everything for public sharing, learning, and reuse
